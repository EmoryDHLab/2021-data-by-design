In his comparative representation of the places where Georgia’s Black citizens reside, for example, Du Bois brings together aspects of the bar chart and the line chart along with a new form of spiral graph in order to give animacy to the presence of Black people in each of type of locale. In a later chart, which documents the decrease in illiteracy rates in the years between 1860 and 1900, Du Bois makes use of what graphic designer Silas Munro describes as a “lattice-like arrangement,” in which an otherwise standard bar is folded at a right angle in order to further accentuate the decreasing rate of illiteracy. Du Bois elaborates upon this technique in a later chart, which compares the numbers of Black property owners, and the value of their properties, in two Georgia cities. Another unique chart in this series, which plots the “assessed value of household and kitchen furniture” owned by Black Georgians, takes the standard bar chart and bends it into a spiral, concentrating the viewer’s focus on the cumulative value of the population’s material possessions in addition to its growth in time. \n","css":{"color":"rgb(16.078432%, 16.078432%, 16.078432%)","background-color":"rgb(100%, 100%, 100%)","font-family":"Roboto","font-weight":"400","font-size":"12PT"}}]},{"type":"table","rows":[[0]],"cells":[[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"styledText","text":"StudentCharts\n","css":{"font-family":"Times","font-weight":"400","font-size":"12PT"}}]}]]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"styledText","text":"As the series unfolds, so too does its argument about the progress of the state’s Black citizens, and it does so in a way in which the data presented is aligned with its method of display.
